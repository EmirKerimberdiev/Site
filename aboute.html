                <p>
                    Hello, I am Emir and here I will tell
                    about myself. As you already know my
                    name is Emir my surname is Kerimberdiev.
                    I was born on December 21, 2007. And I
                    really wanted to become a cybersecurity
                    engineer, but there were very few people
                    in it and it was closed. But I did not
                    despair and quickly chose the
                    profession of DevOps.</p>

                <p>I love skiing, it's fun and very enjoyable.
                    Now it's winter and I'll go uphill and ride abusively.

                <h2>Volleyball</h2>
                <p>And I also love volleyball very much,
                    it is a very fast game that requires a reaction,
                    it’s good that everything is in order with the reaction.

                <h2>Typeng Code</h2>
                <p>
                    I really like to write codes because there are no borders and walls in the code, you can do whatever
                    your heart desires and it's very cool. I already know C ++, they say it's a difficult language and
                    I'm glad that I didn't give up and learned this language for 2 years even in the summer.
